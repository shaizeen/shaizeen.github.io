								<h1>&#161;Hola! I'm <strong>Shaizeen Aga</strong>.</h1>
							</header>
							<p style="font-size:large;"> I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a>. 
							I work with Prof.<a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~nsatish/">Satish Narayanasamy</a> and I am part of 
							<a href="https://www.eecs.umich.edu/celab/">Computer Engineering Lab</a>. My under-graduate alma mater is 
							College of Engineering, Pune, India. <br/> <br/>
							I am interested in broad aspects of computer architecture. My current research focuses on exploiting near-data computing to cope 
							with the data deluge we face today in a performance and energy efficient manner,
							and designing architectural support for efficiently enforcing security 
							guarantees. I am also interested in designing runtime and hardware support to ease 
							programmability. My past projects in this area have been about making more 
							intuitive memory models possible and efficient runtimes for multi-core systems.

<b> Problem context: </b> Ensuring privacy of code and data while executing software on a computer physically owned and maintained by an untrusted party is an open challenge. <br/>

<b> Problem statement: </b> Low-overhead hardware design which provides defenses against memory bus side-channel remains elusive. Current solutions employ Oblivious 
RAM (ORAM) to ensure address confidentiality and incur severe overheads (memory bandwidth~100X, performance~10X). Addressing memory bus side-channel 
completely also requires addressing data integrity, freshness and timing channel which only further add to these overheads. <br/> 

<b> My solution: </b> I implemented a low-overhead hardware design, InvisiMem, in which we employ 3D stacked memory with a logic layer wherein we implement cryptographic primitives to 
provide efficient defenses against memory bus side-channel. Under InvisiMem, the secure processor can send encrypted addresses over the untrusted memory 
bus without having to rely on ORAM. Additional measures are required for address confidentiality which we identify and implement efficiently. We also 
propose an efficient freshness solution (without Merkle trees as in prior works) by establishing secure communication channel between processor and 
memory and using process isolation checks. Finally, we also employ constant heart-beat packets for mitigating memory bus timing channel. <br/>

<b> Result impact: </b>  InvisiMem incurs about 14.21% performance and no memory bandwidth overhead as compared to an order of magnitude performance 
and two orders of magnitude memory bandwidth overhead that prior works incur. These ultra-low overheads will I believe pave the way 
										for production systems to solve memory bus side channel efficiently.</p>

										In-place Computation in Caches</a>

										<b> Problem context: </b> We continue to generate nearly 2.5 quintillion bytes per day and as such, the amounts of data that needs analyzing will only increase with time.  <br/> 

<b> Problem statement: </b> Conventional architectures are not equipped to tackle this data deluge. They expend disproportionately large fraction of time and energy in moving 
data over cache hierarchy, and in instruction processing, as compared to the actual computation. Further, applications which tackle massive data tend to have high degree 
of data parallelism which the narrow vector units in conventional processors fail to exploit. <br/> 

<b> My solution: </b> In this work, I proposed the Compute Cache architecture which transforms caches into active compute units capable of performing in-place computation. This 
transformation unlocks massive data-parallel compute capabilities (~100X wrt SIMD processor), as a cache is comprised of many smaller sub-arrays each of which can compute in 
parallel. This also reduces data movement energy over the cache hierarchy as we can perform computation in cache without moving it towards the processor. Realizing 
Compute Caches brings to forth several challenges like efficient data placement, orchestration of concurrent computation in caches, ensuring soft error reliability 
and more which I address efficiently. <br/> 

<b> Result impact: </b> My study indicates that Compute Cache enabled operations can deliver significant throughput (54X) and total energy savings (14X). For a suite of data-centric 
applications, Compute Caches deliver performance improvement of 1.9X and energy savings of 2.4X while being limited by Amdahlâ€™s law. Future studies to include a richer set 
of operations that can be performed in-place in cache will, I believe, help accelerate larger fractions of applications and close the gap between potential and realized improvements. <br/> 

This work was awarded best demo at Center for Future Architectures Research (CFAR) Annual Workshop 2016 which showcased nearly 50 projects in computer architecture related 
topics from several leading institutions. Also, this work won the 1st place at University of Michigan CSE Graduate Students Honors Competition; a yearly competition which 
recognizes research of broad interest and exceptional quality.

									This project was part of my Internship with High Performance Computing group at <a href="http://www.pnnl.gov/">Pacific Northwest National Labs</a>, Richland, WA. 
My mentor here was <a href="http://hpc.pnl.gov/people/sriram/"> Sriram Krishnamoorthy</a>.<br/>

<b> Problem context: </b> Recursive parallel programming models such as Cilk strive to make it easy for programmers to express parallel programs by enabling a simple divide-and-conquer 
programming model.  <br/> 
<b> Problem statement: </b> Recursive work partitioning can impose additional constraints on concurrency than is implied by the true dependencies in a program thus affecting 
performance. <br/> 
<b> My solution: </b> I address Cilk's inefficiency using a speculation-based approach to alleviate the concurrency constraints imposed by such recursive parallel programs. 
We augment the Cilk runtime infrastructure to support speculative execution and implement a predictor to accurately learn and identify increasing degrees of speculation 
opportunities to relax extraneous concurrency constraints. <br/> 
<b> Result impact: </b> I demonstrated that speculative relaxation of concurrency constraints can deliver considerable performance gains (1.6X on 30 cores) over baseline 
Cilk without compromising the easy of programming that Cilk affords.

									<b> Problem context: </b>  With ubiquity of multi-core systems, a crucial debate is picking the memory model for such systems. Memory model decides the assumptions a programmer can make and 
hence the ease of programmability. <br/> 
<b> Problem statement: </b> Sequential consistency (SC) is arguably the most intuitive memory model but manufacturers instead chose to support relaxed models which allow more performance 
optimizations. Supporting these relaxed models necessitates a fence instruction which is used to implement memory accesses to synchronization variables. The cost of these 
fence instructions remains prohibitively expensive. Efficient fences will not only help improve the performance of todayâ€™s concurrent algorithms, but could also pave the 
way for the adoption of SC model. <br/> 
<b>  My solution: </b> In this work, I observed that a significant fraction of fence overhead is caused by stores that are waiting for data from memory. To exploit this observation,
I proposed the zFence architecture for efficiently implementing a fence by introducing the capability to grant coherence permission for a 
store much earlier than servicing its data from memory. Using this efficient fence instruction we can enable a low-overhead SC design.<br/> 
<b>  Result impact:  </b> Using zFence, I demonstrated that sequential consistent multi-core system is possible for a mere overhead of 2.93%.
